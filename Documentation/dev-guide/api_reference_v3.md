##### message `TxnRequest` (etcdserver/etcdserverpb/rpc.proto)

From google paxosdb paper: Our implementation hinges around a powerful primitive which we call MultiOp. All other database operations except for iteration are implemented as a single call to MultiOp. A MultiOp is applied atomically and consists of three components: 1. A list of tests called guard. Each test in guard checks a single entry in the database. It may check for the absence or presence of a value, or compare with a given value. Two different tests in the guard may apply to the same or different entries in the database. All tests in the guard are applied and MultiOp returns the results. If all tests are true, MultiOp executes t op (see item 2 below), otherwise it executes f op (see item 3 below). 2. A list of database operations called t op. Each operation in the list is either an insert, delete, or lookup operation, and applies to a single database entry. Two different operations in the list may apply to the same or different entries in the database. These operations are executed if guard evaluates to true. 3. A list of database operations called f op. Like t op, but executed if guard evaluates to false.

| Field | Description | Type |

| compare | compare is a list of predicates representing a conjunction of terms. If the comparisons succeed, then the success requests will be processed in order, and the response will contain their respective responses in order. If the comparisons fail, then the failure requests will be processed in order, and the response will contain their respective responses in order. | (slice of) Compare |
| success | success is a list of requests which will be applied when compare evaluates to true. | (slice of) RequestOp |
| failure | failure is a list of requests which will be applied when compare evaluates to false. | (slice of) RequestOp |

##### message `WatchCreateRequest` (etcdserver/etcdserverpb/rpc.proto)

| Field | Description | Type |
| ----- | ----------- | ---- |
| key | key is the key to register for watching. | bytes |
| range_end | range_end is the end of the range [key, range_end) to watch. If range_end is not given, only the key argument is watched. If range_end is equal to '\0', all keys greater than or equal to the key argument are watched. If the range_end is one bit larger than the given key, then all keys with the prefix (the given key) will be watched. | bytes |
| start_revision | start_revision is an optional revision to watch from (inclusive). No start_revision is "now". | int64 |
| progress_notify | progress_notify is set so that the etcd server will periodically send a WatchResponse with no events to the new watcher if there are no recent events. It is useful when clients wish to recover a disconnected watcher starting from a recent known revision. The etcd server may decide how often it will send notifications based on current load. | bool |
| filters | filters filter the events at server side before it sends back to the watcher. | (slice of) FilterType |
| prev_kv | If prev_kv is set, created watcher gets the previous KV before the event happens. If the previous KV is already compacted, nothing will be returned. | bool |
| watch_id | If watch_id is provided and non-zero, it will be assigned to this watcher. Since creating a watcher in etcd is not a synchronous operation, this can be used ensure that ordering is correct when creating multiple watchers on the same stream. Creating a watcher with an ID already in use on the stream will cause an error to be returned. | int64 |
| fragment | fragment enables splitting large revisions into multiple watch responses. | bool |

| header |  | ResponseHeader |
| watch_id | watch_id is the ID of the watcher that corresponds to the response. | int64 |

| canceled | canceled is set to true if the response is for a cancel watch request. No further events will be sent to the canceled watcher. | bool |
| compact_revision | compact_revision is set to the minimum index if a watcher tries to watch at a compacted index.  This happens when creating a watcher at a compacted revision or the watcher cannot catch up with the progress of the key-value store.  The client should treat the watcher as canceled and should not try to create any watcher with the same start_revision again. | int64 |
