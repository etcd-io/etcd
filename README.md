etcd is a distributed reliable key-value store for the most critical data of a distributed system, with a focus on being:

* *Simple*: well-defined, user-facing API (gRPC)
* *Secure*: automatic TLS with optional client cert authentication
* *Fast*: benchmarked 10,000 writes/sec
* *Reliable*: properly distributed using Raft

etcd is written in Go and uses the [Raft][raft] consensus algorithm to manage a highly-available replicated log.

etcd is used [in production by many companies](./Documentation/production-users.md), and the development team stands behind it in critical deployment scenarios, where etcd is frequently teamed with applications such as [Kubernetes][k8s], [locksmith][locksmith], [vulcand][vulcand], [Doorman][doorman], and many others. Reliability is further ensured by rigorous [testing][etcd-tests].

See [etcdctl][etcdctl] for a simple command line client.

## Community meetings

etcd contributors and maintainers have bi-weekly meetings at 11:00 AM (USA Pacific) on Tuesdays. There is an [iCalendar][rfc5545] format for the meetings [here](meeting.ics). Anyone is welcome to join via [Zoom][zoom] or audio-only: +1 669 900 6833. An initial agenda will be posted to the [shared Google docs][shared-meeting-notes] a day before each meeting, and everyone is welcome to suggest additional topics or other agendas.

## Getting started

### Getting etcd

The easiest way to get etcd is to use one of the pre-built release binaries which are available for OSX, Linux, Windows, [rkt][rkt], and Docker. Instructions for using these binaries are on the [GitHub releases page][github-release].

For those wanting to try the very latest version, [build the latest version of etcd][dl-build] from the `master` branch. This first needs [*Go*](https://golang.org/) installed (version 1.9+ is required). All development occurs on `master`, including new features and bug fixes. Bug fixes are first targeted at `master` and subsequently ported to release branches, as described in the [branch management][branch-management] guide.

[rkt]: https://github.com/rkt/rkt/releases/
[github-release]: https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/
[branch-management]: ./Documentation/branch_management.md
[dl-build]: ./Documentation/dl_build.md#build-the-latest-version

### Running etcd

First start a single-member cluster of etcd.

If etcd is installed using the [pre-built release binaries][github-release], run it from the installation location as below:

```sh
/tmp/etcd-download-test/etcd
```
The etcd command can be simply run as such if it is moved to the system path as below:

```sh
mv /tmp/etcd-download-test/etcd /usr/local/bin/

etcd
```

If etcd is [build from the master branch][dl-build], run it as below:

```sh
./bin/etcd
```

This will bring up etcd listening on port 2379 for client communication and on port 2380 for server-to-server communication.

Next, let's set a single key, and then retrieve it:

```
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl put mykey "this is awesome"
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl get mykey
```

That's it! etcd is now running and serving client requests. For more

### etcd TCP ports

The [official etcd ports][iana-ports] are 2379 for client requests, and 2380 for peer communication.

### Running a local etcd cluster

First install [goreman](https://github.com/mattn/goreman), which manages Procfile-based applications.

Our [Procfile script](./Procfile) will set up a local example cluster. Start it with:

```sh
goreman start
```

This will bring up 3 etcd members `infra1`, `infra2` and `infra3` and etcd `grpc-proxy`, which runs locally and composes a cluster.

Every cluster member and proxy accepts key value reads and key value writes.

### Running etcd on Kubernetes

To run an etcd cluster on Kubernetes, try [etcd operator](https://github.com/coreos/etcd-operator).
