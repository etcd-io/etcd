// Progress represents a followerâ€™s progress in the view of the leader. Leader
// maintains progresses of all followers, and sends entries to the follower
// based on its progress.

// strewn around `*raft.raft`. Additionally, some fields are only used when in a
// certain State. All of this isn't ideal.

	//
	// When in StateProbe, leader sends at most one replication message
	// per heartbeat interval. It also probes actual progress of the follower.
	//
	// When in StateReplicate, leader optimistically increases next
	// to the latest entry sent after sending replication message. This is
	// an optimized state for fast replicating log entries to the follower.

	// before and stops sending any replication message.
