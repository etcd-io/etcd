# Regression test that verifies that learners can vote. This holds only in the
# sense that if a learner is asked to vote, a candidate believes that they are a
# voter based on its current config, which may be more recent than that of the
# learner. If learners which are actually voters but don't know it yet don't
# vote in that situation, the raft group may end up unavailable despite a quorum
# of voters (as of the latest config) being available.

# n2 is now campaigning while n1 is down (does not respond). The latest config
# has n3 as a voter, but n3 doesn't even have the corresponding conf change in
# its log. Still, it casts a vote for n2 which can in turn become leader and
